# Project Description
In this Car price prediction project, we employed a diverse dataset of only mercedes company encompassing attributes such as model, year, price etc. Our project journey commenced with meticulous data preprocessing, addressing missing values, duplicates, and eliminating outliers to ensure data quality. Subsequently, we delved into a comprehensive data analysis using Matplotlib, leveraging various visualizations to gain insights. Employing a train-test split, we evaluated five distinct regression models, including Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Decision Tree Regression, and Random Forest Regression. The Random Forest model emerged as the preferred choice due to its superior R-squared score and accuracy. Our dataset was sourced from Kaggle, containing multiple car brand datasets, adding diversity to our analysis. In conclusion, our project culminated in a robust Random Forest model capable of predicting Mercedes car prices effectively, contributing to data-driven decision-making in the automotive market.

# Business Goals and Limitations
Our primary goal is to empower consumers and car dealerships with a reliable tool for estimating Mercedes car prices. However, it’s important to acknowledge the limitations of our model as well.

## Business Goals:
### **Price Transparency**: Our goal is to provide consumers with a tool that promotes transparency in Mercedes car pricing. By doing so, we aim to empower them to make more informed purchasing decisions.
### **Optimized Pricing for Dealerships:** We also intend to assist car dealerships in setting competitive and fair prices for their Mercedes cars. This not only benefits consumers but also helps dealerships maximize their sales and profitability.
### **Market Efficiency:** Through accurate price predictions, our goal is to contribute to the overall efficiency of the automotive market.

## Limitations:
Predictions may vary due to differences in data quality and availability.

### **Individual Car Condition:** Not all cars of the same make and model are identical; individual car conditions can vary significantly.
### **External Factors:** Market shifts, economic conditions, and regional demand can influence car prices beyond our dataset’s scope.
