# Project Description
In this Car price prediction project, we employed a diverse dataset of mercedes company encompassing attributes such as model, year, price etc. Our project journey commenced with meticulous data preprocessing, addressing missing values, duplicates, and eliminating outliers to ensure data quality. Subsequently, we delved into a comprehensive data analysis using Matplotlib, leveraging various visualizations to gain insights. Employing a train-test split, we evaluated five distinct regression models, including Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Decision Tree Regression, and Random Forest Regression. The Random Forest model emerged as the preferred choice due to its superior R-squared score and accuracy. Our dataset was sourced from Kaggle, containing multiple car brand datasets, adding diversity to our analysis. In conclusion, our project culminated in a robust Random Forest model capable of predicting Mercedes car prices effectively, contributing to data-driven decision-making in the automotive market.
